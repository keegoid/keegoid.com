With that out of the way, let's dive in!

I'm constantly updating/improving my routines as society learns more about what works for humans, and I learn more about what works for this human.

My goal is to slow and/or reverse aging by minimizing stress, eating healthy, adding supplements where needed, exercising regularly, and maintaining connections with friends.

## Morning Light and Nutrients

I start most days with red and near-infrared light therapy. The panel I use hangs from my bedroom door and emits 5 frequencies of light. The health term for this kind of treatment is called photobiomodulation (PBM). *No autocorrect, that's not discombobulation.*

I pour a tall glass of water filtered in a copper container for additional ions and a wonderfully fresh taste. Add 3 scoops of Mt. Capra Mineral Whey.

*Note: 1x means 1 capsule.*

1. 1x Pentadecylic acid (C15:0)
1. 2x Seed probiotic
1. 3x AKG
1. 5x nattokinase + serrapeptase

I don't eat for 2 hours to allow the nattokinase and serrapeptase to work on fibrin in my arteries.

This morning routine has had an especially powerful impact on my health. I used to get chest pains and feel like my chest was heavy and breathing was not effortless. It has made such a huge difference for me. I no longer have chest pains and I can breathe easy again. I feel like I have my life back.

### Mid-morning Smoothie

I look for canned black olives without too many extra ingredients. They are typically marketed as "Crafted". I buy the Lindsay brand from WinCo because the price is hard to beat. Ingredients are: ripe olives, water, sea salt. Rinse the olives in a strainer to remove as much of the sea salt as possible and store in a glass container in the fridge. I eat about 1/3 of a can as the first food of my day.

Next, in a large blender cup (I use a Nutribullet) add:

1. one whole lemon (peel and all) or one whole apple (I do lemon one day and apple the next)
1. baby carrots
1. organic blueberries
1. fill with water to 1/3 level with fruit in the cup already
1. 2 scoops of Fermented Goat-Milk Protein
1. 2 scoops of Organic Lion's Mane Mushroom powder
1. 1 scoop of creatine monohydrate

Make sure to wash the fruit thoroughly with a vegetable soap followed by white vinegar to rinse of any pesticides, including organic pesticides. I use two different colors of spray bottles to hold the soap and vinegar.

### Lunch with Proteins and Fats

This is the biggest meal of my day.

### After 5 PM

- Wed - Thu | Strength training exercises

### Saturday

10K run
