With that out of the way, let's dive in!

My goal is to slow or reverse aging by minimizing stress, eating healthy, adding supplements where needed, exercising regularly, and maintaining connections with friends. A longer healthspan means staying healthy for longer so that if/when age-related decline happens, I'm still well above the point where I would lose mobility and quality of life.

I'm constantly updating and tweaking my routines as society learns more about what works for humans (and as I learn more about what works for this human). I've organized the content into sections:

1. [[#What I do]]
2. [[#What I don't do]]

## What I do

### Morning minerals plus anti-fibrin

Monday through Friday, I start the morning with a tall glass of water filtered by [Sertodo Copper Sana Vida Copper Water Filtration Systems](https://sertodo.com/products/sertodo-copper-water-filter-system?variant=45714273501429) for additional ions and a wonderfully fresh taste. I add 3 scoops of Mt. Capra's [Capra Mineral Whey](https://mtcapra.com/product/capra-mineral-whey-goat-milk-minerals/)[^1].

I drink the mineral water with 5 capsules of [Neprinol AFD (Advanced Fibrin Defense)](https://amzn.to/3zzFf9j). It contains enzymes [nattokinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nattokinase) + [serrapeptase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratiopeptidase) that act on [fibrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin) in the body[^2].

### Morning light

While Neprinol goes to work on the fibrin that makes up my blood clots, I hang out in front of a red and near-infrared light. I have a [Rojo panel](https://www.rojolighttherapy.com/) that hangs from my bedroom door on a pulley so I can move it up and down while standing in front of it naked. Finally my own personal nude beach at sunrise!

[[#Why I use red light therapy]]

1. 1 capsule Pentadecylic acid (C15:0)
1. 2 capsules Seed probiotic

### Mid-morning Smoothie

I look for canned black olives without too many extra ingredients. They are typically marketed as "Crafted". I buy the Lindsay brand from WinCo because the price is hard to beat. Ingredients are: ripe olives, water, sea salt. Rinse the olives in a strainer to remove as much of the sea salt as possible and store in a glass container in the fridge. I eat about 1/3 of a can as the first food of my day.

Next, in a large blender cup (I use a Nutribullet) add:

1. one whole lemon (peel and all) or one whole apple (I do lemon one day and apple the next)
1. baby carrots
1. organic blueberries
1. fill with water to 1/3 level with fruit in the cup already
1. 2 scoops of Fermented Goat-Milk Protein
1. 2 scoops of Organic Lion's Mane Mushroom powder
1. 1 scoop of creatine monohydrate

Make sure to wash the fruit thoroughly with a vegetable soap followed by white vinegar to rinse of any pesticides, including organic pesticides. I use two different colors of spray bottles to hold the soap and vinegar.

### Lunch with Proteins and Fats

This is the biggest meal of my day.

### After 5 PM

- Wed - Thu | Strength training exercises

### Saturday

10K run

### Sunday and Monday

Recovery days

## What I don't do

- I don't take [Capra Mineral Whey](https://mtcapra.com/product/capra-mineral-whey-goat-milk-minerals/) before, during, or after exercise because sweating eliminates more salt from the body.
- I don't eat for 2 hours to allow the nattokinase and serrapeptase to work on fibrin in my arteries.
- I don't take [Neprinol AFD](https://amzn.to/3zzFf9j) on weekends or days I'm going to do heavy exercise. Nattokinase and serrapeptase might increase the risk of bleeding.
- I don't spend too long in front of the [Rojo panel](https://www.rojolighttherapy.com/). Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. Max is 40 minutes for me.

## How I do it

This is the how-to section for those who, like me, get excited about actually implementing longevity techniques that show promise!

### How I take Neprinol AFD

I initially thought I could do what the Japanese do and eat [Natto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D) more often. I gave it a go for a week. Alas, I couldn't deal with the taste and texture.

### How I use red light therapy

The [Rojo panel](https://www.rojolighttherapy.com/) emits 5 frequencies of light which kind of bleed into each other on the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum).

While the Rojo panel does allow controlling each frequency's power level individually, it's hard to know what the right levels should be. So I just set all 5 frequencies to 100%.

I stand 6 inches away for muscle recovery, and 3 feet away for eye treatments (still at 100% power). According to the [inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law), the farther you stand from the panel the lower the intensity.

I like to catch up on my favorite YouTube videos while I stand in front of the light for 20-40 minutes. A larger panel reduces treatment time because it can cover the whole body, turning 180 degrees half-way through. I have a smaller panel so I focus on the most sore areas, spending at least 10 minutes on each.

By the end my skin is pink and warm, joints are loose, and mitochondrial batteries recharged. It's a nice way to start the day.

By the way,  the term for this kind of treatment is [photobiomodulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy),  PBM for short[^3].

## Why I do what I do

What follows are my reasons for the supplements I take and what I aim to achieve for my own health and longevity goals. My reasons may not be accurate and I might have gaps in my knowledge that could cause harm. In other words, do your own research before choosing to embark on a journey like mine.

### Why I take Capra Mineral Whey

Capra Mineral Whey has a high ratio of potassium to sodium. I like that because it's hard to get enough potassium.

### Why I take Neprinol AFD

Neprinol is certainly one of the more expensive supplements I take. However, of all the supplements, Neprinol has been **by far** the most impactful for me.[^2]

I used to get daily pain and tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing. That is completely gone. I started taking Neprinol about a year before I started exercising regularly and noticed a marked improvement after the first month. I can't recommend this highly enough for cardiovascular health.

### Why I use red light therapy

I use red light therapy to:

1. Reduce inflammation and pain.
1. Enhance muscle recovery.
1. Increase blood flow to my retinas.
1. Improve mitochondrial health.

I aim to:

1. Keep my joints healthy as I age.
1. Gain weight by increasing muscle mass.
1. Reduce the risk of [age-related macular degeneration (AMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration).
1. Increase healthspan and keep youthful energy as I age.
